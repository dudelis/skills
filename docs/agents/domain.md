# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists: it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. In multi-context repos, also check `skills/<bucket>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## Current contents

The root `CONTEXT.md` currently defines the **Tracker** vocabulary (Customer, Project, Task, Task Candidate, Triage) used by the `tracker-*` skills. That vocabulary applies to tracker skill content only. It does not govern the engineering workflow: GitHub issues are still called "tickets" or "issues", and "triage" in `/triage` means GitHub issue triage, not Task Candidate review.

## File structure

Single-context repo (this repo):

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-<decision>.md
│   └── 0002-<decision>.md
└── skills/
```

Multi-context repo (presence of `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root):

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
└── skills/
    ├── tracker/
    │   ├── CONTEXT.md
    │   └── docs/adr/                  ← context-specific decisions
    └── ecommerce/
        ├── CONTEXT.md
        └── docs/adr/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_
